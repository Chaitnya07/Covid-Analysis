This repository contains a comprehensive dataset for analyzing the impact of COVID-19 across different countries, focusing on daily cases, deaths, recoveries, testing, and population age structures. The goal is to use this data to estimate the true death rate of COVID-19 and investigate the relationship with age.

## Dataset Overview

- **Dataset 1**: Daily statistics for COVID-19 by country, including:
  - Number of tests performed
  - Confirmed cases
  - Deaths
  - Serious/Critical cases
  - Active cases
  - Recovered cases
  - Population data for per-capita calculations

- **Dataset 2**: Auxiliary dataset containing age group distributions for each country (sourced from Wikipedia), which helps assess age-related vulnerabilities to the virus.

## Key Insights

- Analyzing the number of tests and the impact on the true death rate of COVID-19.
- Exploring the age structure of populations to better understand the correlation between age and mortality rates.
- Country-level comparisons of COVID-19 statistics.

## Analysis and Visualization

This project uses **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Seaborn**, and **Plotly** for data analysis and visualization. The notebooks explore key metrics such as:

- Test coverage vs. death rate
- Age-wise population impact on COVID-19 mortality
- Active and recovered cases by country
